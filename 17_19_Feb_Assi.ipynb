    "#### Answer ):-\n",
    "Flask is micro web framework written in python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides developers with tools, libraries and technologies that allow them to build a web application from scratch. Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or per-determined project structure.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Advantages\n",
    "1.) A Basic Web Application Structure: Flask offers flexibility and a barebones structure to start with. This gives developers plenty of options regarding the architecture of their app.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Jinja Templating System: Flask comes with a lightweight templating system called Jinja. It helps developers create dynamic webpages with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Integrated Unit Testing Support: Flask has integrated testing support out of the box. This allows developers to quickly set up and run tests as they build their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Flexibility : It is known for its flexibility due to its lightweight nature and modular design. Flask allows developers to easily switch between different components like templating systems and libraries, providing flexibility for different frameworks."
